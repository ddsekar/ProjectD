Dear keytab enablement team,

I am writing to request an extension of the deadline for keytab enablement for the p2abwp account from November 30 to the end of January.

We are currently working on keytab enablement for this account, but we are facing a challenge in getting consent from all application owners within the November 30 deadline. This account is widely used by many applications, and it is difficult to coordinate with all of them in such a short timeframe.

An extension of the deadline would allow us to plan accordingly and ensure that all applications are properly configured for keytab authentication before the new deadline.

We appreciate your understanding and flexibility in this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your name]
